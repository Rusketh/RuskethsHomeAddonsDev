These are Home Assistant (HA) addons that I have been working on for personal use.
This repository is for development builds allowing me to work on addons with out sending out bad builds to other users who may find my addons useful.
If you wish to use one of these addons in home assistant I recomend you install it via the main repository https://github.com/Rusketh/RuskethsHomeAddons where I try upload only stable builds.
